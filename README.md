 The Car Rental System is a C++ application that simulates the process of renting cars. It connects to a MySQL database to store and 
 retrieve car information and their availability status. The application allows users to view available cars, select a car for rent, 
 and updates the database accordingly.

2. Car Information: Stores car details such as serial number, brand, model, rent, and availability.
3. Availability Check: Checks the availability of a car before allowing it to be rented.
4. Update Availability: Updates the database to mark a car as rented once it is selected.
5. User Interface: Provides a console-based user interface for interacting with the system.


**Dependencies--**
1. MySQL: The application uses MySQL for storing and retrieving car data.
2. MySQL Connector: MySQL C API is used for connecting and querying the database.
3. Windows.h: Used for Sleep function to pause the execution for a specified time.
